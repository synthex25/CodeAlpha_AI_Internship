# Task 2 – AI FAQ Chatbot using NLP

## Description
This project is an AI-based FAQ chatbot developed using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The chatbot answers a wide range of **Artificial Intelligence-related questions** by identifying the most relevant response using similarity matching techniques.

Instead of hard-coded rules, the chatbot uses **TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity**, making it scalable and easy to extend with additional AI knowledge.

## Features
- Answers common and advanced AI-related questions
- Uses NLP techniques instead of if-else logic
- Expandable knowledge base
- Clean and interactive command-line interface
- Beginner-friendly and explainable AI logic

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Cosine Similarity
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

---

## How It Works
1. Predefined AI-related questions are converted into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**.
2. User input is also converted into a vector.
3. **Cosine similarity** finds the closest matching question.
4. The chatbot returns the corresponding answer in real time.

## How to Run

1. Install required library:
pip install scikit-learn

2. Run the chatbot:
python chatbot.py

3. Ask questions related to Artificial Intelligence.
4. Type `exit` to quit the chatbot.
