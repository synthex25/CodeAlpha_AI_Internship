# CodeAlpha AI Internship Projects

## Overview
This repository contains all the projects completed as part of the  
**CodeAlpha Artificial Intelligence Internship**.

The projects demonstrate practical applications of **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Pattern-Based AI** using Python.  
Each task is implemented in a modular and beginner-friendly manner with proper documentation.

## Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1 – Language Translation Tool using AI
An AI-based language translation tool that translates user input into **multiple languages** using a pre-trained NLP model.
The application dynamically loads supported languages, displays clean formatted output, and includes an optional **text-to-speech** feature.

📂 Folder: `Task1_Language_Translation`  
**Technologies:** Python, GoogleTrans, gTTS, NLP

---

### ✅ Task 2 – AI FAQ Chatbot
A FAQ-based AI chatbot that answers **Artificial Intelligence-related questions** using Natural Language Processing.
The chatbot uses **TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity** to find the most relevant responses instead of hard-coded logic.

📂 Folder: `Task2_AI_FAQ_Chatbot`  
**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, NLP

---

### ✅ Task 3 – Music Generation using AI
An AI-based music generation system that learns musical note patterns and generates new music sequences.
The generated output is saved as a **MIDI file**, which can be played using a media player.

📂 Folder: `Task3_Music_Generation`  
**Technologies:** Python, music21, NumPy, Pattern-Based AI

---

### ✅ Task 4 – Object Detection and Tracking using AI
A real-time object detection and tracking system using a pre-trained **YOLO deep learning model**.
The system detects and tracks objects from a live webcam feed and displays bounding boxes with labels.

📂 Folder: `Task4_Object_Detection`  
**Technologies:** Python, YOLO (Ultralytics), OpenCV, Deep Learning, Computer Vision
