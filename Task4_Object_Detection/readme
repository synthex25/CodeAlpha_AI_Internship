# Task 4 – Object Detection and Tracking using AI

## Description
This project demonstrates a real-time **Object Detection and Tracking system** using Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.
A pre-trained **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** deep learning model is used to detect and track objects from a live webcam feed.

The system identifies objects such as people, mobile phones, bottles, chairs, etc., and displays bounding boxes with labels and tracking IDs in real time.

---

## Features
- Real-time object detection using webcam
- Object tracking across video frames
- Bounding boxes with object labels
- Uses a pre-trained deep learning model (YOLO)
- Simple and efficient implementation

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLO (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision

---

## How It Works
1. The webcam captures live video frames.
2. Each frame is processed by the YOLO deep learning model.
3. Objects are detected and bounding boxes are drawn.
4. Object tracking assigns IDs to detected objects.
5. The annotated video is displayed in real time.

---

## How to Run

1. Install required libraries:
pip install ultralytics opencv-python

2. Run the program:
python object_detection.py

3. Press **`q`** to exit the application.

---

## Sample Output
- Objects are detected with bounding boxes
- Labels such as *person*, *bottle*, *chair*, etc., are displayed
- Objects are tracked as they move in the video

## Internship Task
This project was developed as **Task 4 – Object Detection and Tracking**  
for the **CodeAlpha Artificial Intelligence Internship**.
