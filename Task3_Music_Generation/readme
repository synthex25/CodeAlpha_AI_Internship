# Task 3 – Music Generation using AI

## Description
This project demonstrates an **AI-based music generation system** developed using Python.
The system generates new musical sequences by learning patterns from existing musical notes and produces the output in **MIDI format**, which can be played using any standard media player.

The project focuses on **pattern-based AI**, making it simple, explainable, and suitable for beginners.

---

## Features
- Generates new music automatically
- Uses learned musical note patterns
- Adds rhythm using different note durations
- Outputs music in MIDI format
- Easy to run and modify

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- music21
- NumPy
- Artificial Intelligence (Pattern-based learning)

---

## How It Works
1. A predefined set of musical notes is used as training data.
2. The system learns patterns from these notes.
3. New sequences of notes are generated using probabilistic selection.
4. Generated notes are converted into a **MIDI file**.
5. The MIDI file can be played using a media player.

---

## How to Run

1. Install required libraries:
pip install music21 numpy

2. Run the program:
python music_generator.py

3. A file named `generated_music.mid` will be created.
4. Open the MIDI file to listen to the generated music.

---

## Sample Output
- A MIDI file containing AI-generated music
- Each execution generates a slightly different music pattern

## Internship Task
This project was developed as **Task 3 – Music Generation with AI**  
for the **CodeAlpha Artificial Intelligence Internship**.
