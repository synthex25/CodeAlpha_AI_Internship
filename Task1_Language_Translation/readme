# Task 1 – Language Translation Tool using AI

## Description
This project is an AI-based language translation tool developed using Python.
It allows users to translate text from one language to **any supported language** using a pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) model.

The application dynamically loads available languages, provides clean formatted output, and includes an optional **text-to-speech** feature for better user interaction.

---

## Features
- Supports **100+ languages** (auto-loaded)
- Menu-driven language selection
- Clean and readable console output
- Optional text-to-speech for translated text
- Real-time AI-powered translation
- Beginner-friendly implementation

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- GoogleTrans (AI Translation Library)
- gTTS (Text-to-Speech)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

---

## How It Works
1. User enters text to be translated.
2. User selects the target language from a dynamically generated list.
3. The AI translation model processes the text.
4. The translated output is displayed clearly.
5. Optional text-to-speech converts the output into audio.

## How to Run

1. Install required libraries:
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
pip install gTTS


2. Run the program:
python translator.py
